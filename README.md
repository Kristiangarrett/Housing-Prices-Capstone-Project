# Housing-Prices-Capstone-Project
This is the repository for my capstone project

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I read an article in the Washington Post stating that the amount of wealth that Millennials have tied into real estate is almost zero in comparison to multiple other generations including but not limited to Gen X and Boomers.. I wanted to dive into this and look as far back as I could to see what kind of people own houses.

MOTIVATION 
Back in 2008, the housing market collapsed. I was 20 and I was working in restaurants and it didnâ€™t really mean much to me at the time, but now I am 32 and I am looking into buying a home. I think there is something very valuable data wise to show the rise in the prices of houses and the ages of people buying them.

DATA QUESTION:
What kind of people are buying houses?
Is there any correlation to who is buying houses in comparison to wealth?

SCHEDULE 
Get all the data by June 4th
Clean data by June 9th
Create Presentation

KNOWN ISSUES AND CHALLENGES 
Will I get everything done in time?
Is what I find going to be interesting?

I think my focus is going to be just cleaning the data in Python to work on my Python chops and making sure I document everything in Github for practice as well.

I am positive the project that I do will be great presentation wise, but I am worried if I am doing everything right in Github.
